## Hi there 👋
I'm Sanders, and I'm currently studying computer science and math at Bethany Lutheran College. I aim to become a software engineer after college. I'm passionate about technology, sports, and anything related to the science world. 

I'm currently learning about full-stack development and algorithms, but I'm open to diving into any other field for projects or to feed my curiosity.
